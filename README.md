## 🚨 **WARNING: DANGEROUS HACKER ALERT** 🚨

**SKILLS:**
- 💀 Can use `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` like a PRO
- 🔥 Once opened CMD and people thought I'm hacking NASA
- 💻 Downloaded Kali Linux (never used it but it looks cool)
- 🧠 Asked ChatGPT for code and pretended it's mine
- 🎮 Running a Minecraft server (basically a cyber operation)

---

## 👨‍💻 **About This "Hacker"**

I'm basically **Popesco 2.0** but with less skills and more AI help.

- 🎯 **Current Mission**: Hiding from FBI after changing Windows theme to dark mode
- 🍊 **Side Quest**: [RexSystems](https://github.com/RexSystems) - Totally legit hacking organization
- 🎮 **Cover Operation**: [Lavand MC Network](http://discord.gg/lavand) - For intelligence gathering (and fun)
- 🤖 **Secret Weapon**: Claude & ChatGPT (they do all the work, I take credit)

---

## 🎓 **"Education"**

- 📚 YouTube University - Major in Copy-Paste Engineering
- 🔐 Google School of "How to fix error" - PhD pending
- 🤖 ChatGPT Academy - Currently teaching AI to code for me
- 💀 Stack Overflow - Where I found all my "original" solutions

---

## 💀 **Legendary Hacks**
```bash
# My most dangerous operations:
$ sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root  # (in VM, I'm not THAT stupid)
$ tree                               # People think I'm in Matrix
$ sl                                 # Train goes brrrr
$ cmatrix                           # Instant hacker mode activated
$ echo "I'm in"                     # Every movie ever
```

## 🛠️ **Arsenal**

**Languages I Google Daily:**
- JavaScript (copy from StackOverflow)
- Python (if ChatGPT writes it)
- PHP (when I'm desperate)
- Bash (one-liners from Reddit)
- HTML (it's not real programming but I'll take it)

**Tools:**
- 🐧 **Linux** - Because Windows is for normies
- 🖥️ **Proxmox** - Where I break VMs professionally
- 🐳 **Docker** - `docker-compose up` and pray
- 🔥 **AI Models** - My actual developers
- ☕ **Coffee** - Liquid debugging fluid

---

## 🎯 **Current Operations**

- [ ] Learn to code (ETA: Never)
- [x] Pretend I know what I'm doing
- [x] Blame everything on DNS
- [ ] Hide from FBI
- [x] Use AI for everything
- [x] Take credit for AI's work

---

## 💀 **Confessions of a Fake Hacker**

- I don't actually know how Docker works, I just run `docker-compose up`
- 90% of my code is from ChatGPT/Claude
- I once broke production by running `rm -rf` in wrong directory
- My "hacking" is just reading error messages
- I call myself developer but mostly I just Google stuff
- The green Matrix text makes me feel cool tho
